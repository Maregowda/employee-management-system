# "Employee Management System - Node.js Backend Project Report"
The Employee Management System is a backend project built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It provides an easy-to-use RESTful API for managing employee records, allowing users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database. The project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and incorporates middleware to handle authentication and error handling.
  
# Tech Stack

* Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for executing server-side code.
* Express.js: A popular web application framework for Node.js, used to handle routing and HTTP requests.
* MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store employee data in a flexible and scalable manner.
* Middleware: Express.js middleware is used to handle authentication and error handling.
* REST API: The application follows RESTful principles to provide a standardized API interface.

# Features

* CRUD Operations
The Employee Management System allows users to perform the following CRUD operations on employee records:

Create: Users can add new employees to the database with relevant details such as name, email, job title, and department.
Read: Employees' information can be retrieved from the database based on their ID, name, department, or other relevant criteria.
Update: Users can modify the existing employee information, such as updating their job title or department.
Delete: Employees can be removed from the database by their ID or other criteria.
* Authentication Middleware
To secure the API endpoints, the application implements authentication middleware. Users are required to provide valid credentials (e.g., username and password) or access tokens to access protected routes.

* Error Handling
The project includes error-handling middleware to catch and respond to any errors that may occur during API requests. This enhances the application's robustness and provides meaningful error responses to clients.

# Architecture - MVC (Model-View-Controller)
The project follows the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern to maintain a clear separation of concerns. Each component has its specific role:

* Model: Represents the data structure and handles interactions with the MongoDB database. It deals with CRUD operations on the employee data.
* View: In this backend context, the view corresponds to the data that is sent back as a response (e.g., JSON data for API requests).
* Controller: The controller receives incoming HTTP requests, processes them, interacts with the model to perform required operations, and sends back the appropriate response (view).
This separation of concerns enhances maintainability and allows for easier testing and scalability.

# Project Setup
To run the Employee Management System, follow these steps:

* Install Node.js and MongoDB on the server.
* Clone the project repository from the designated version control system (e.g., GitHub).
* Install project dependencies using npm install.
* Set up the MongoDB connection configuration (e.g., URL and credentials) in the application.
* Run the application using npm start or a similar script.
# API Endpoints
The following API endpoints are available in the Employee Management System:

GET /api/employees: Get a list of all employees.
GET /api/employees/:id: Get an employee by their ID.
POST /api/employees: Create a new employee record.
PUT /api/employees/:id: Update an employee's information by their ID.
DELETE /api/employees/:id: Delete an employee by their ID
